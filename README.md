#### Hello, world. Gozman here.

I build web systems that are deliberate, opinionated, and boring in the right ways, prioritizing clear boundaries, intentional design, and long-term maintainability.

I care about clean APIs, sensible abstractions, and code that doesn’t fight the next person who has to read it—which is usually me. Most of my work lives in TypeScript, with a growing interest in backend architecture, tooling, and systems thinking. I’ve also been spending time learning Go.

If you’re working on something interesting, care about building things well, and think I’d be a good fit, feel free to reach out.
